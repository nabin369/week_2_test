* Explain what a branch is, in your own words

When you commit in Git, Git sotres a commit object
that contains the pointer to the snapshot of the 
content that is stagged, the message. The branch
in Git is simply a pointer to one of these commits.
The default branch name in git is master. Initial
commits are given a branch master that points to 
the last commit made. Everytime commit is made, it
moves forward automatically.
